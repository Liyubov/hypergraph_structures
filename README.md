# methods to work with hypergraphs structures
Repository for collection of computer science methods and mathematical approaches to work with hypergraph structures.


## methods and existing repositories 

One of the most central repository is https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi/tree/main/tutorials 

## analytical approaches 
The existing approaches towards studying hypergraph structures and n-arity itself is described in the recent works from Carlos Zapatta and collaborators working on ("Beyond Binary: Hypermatrix Algebra and Irreducible Arity in Higher-Order Systems")[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367251087_Beyond_Binary_Hypermatrix_Algebra_and_Irreducible_Arity_in_Higher-Order_Systems] with the aim to connect both algebraic and geometric structures.
