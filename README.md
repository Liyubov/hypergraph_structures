# methods to work with hypergraphs structures
Repository for collection of computer science methods and mathematical approaches to work with hypergraph structures.


## methods comparison 
We are working and comparing various existing frameworks and computational languages 

1. Here we explore the computational languages of python (numpy and non-numpy frameworks) to calculate the graph rewriting systems  https://github.com/Liyubov/hypergraphs_structures/blob/main/code%20notebooks/hyper_graph_motif_counting_rewriting_numpy.ipynb
2. Here we expore other existing packages for computing projected hypergraph properties https://github.com/Liyubov/hypergraphs_structures 

## methods and existing repositories 


There are specific thematic resources dedicated to the analysis of the hypergraph structures:

1. hypercore decomposition analysis https://github.com/marco-mancastroppa/hypercore-decomposition
2. hypergraph motifs analysis https://github.com/FraLotito/higher-order-motifs
3. hypergraph rewriting (recent work in progress on testing Mathematica integrated module) https://github.com/Liyubov/hypergraphs_structures/
   related to this large part of work is developed and inspired by Wolfram Institute work 
https://github.com/phcerdan/wolfram_model


The tutorials repository is https://github.com/xgi-org/xgi/tree/main/tutorials 

## analytical approaches 
The existing approaches towards studying hypergraph structures and n-arity itself is described in the recent works from Carlos Zapatta and collaborators working on ("Beyond Binary: Hypermatrix Algebra and Irreducible Arity in Higher-Order Systems")[https://www.researchgate.net/publication/367251087_Beyond_Binary_Hypermatrix_Algebra_and_Irreducible_Arity_in_Higher-Order_Systems] with the aim to connect both algebraic and geometric structures. 


## testing examples of the hypergraphs 

Here we test the basic example of the knowledge hypergraph, generated from the arxiv data and motivated on the recent work presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.03749 and https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0270131


This is in the joint effort and collaboration with Carlos Zapata, who have shared the open problems and priniciples in the hypergraph theory, author of the framework https://arity.science/
